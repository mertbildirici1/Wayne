        The Wayne Manor (WM) is an all-male selective living group (SLG) at Duke
        University in Durham, North Carolina. The organization is known
        informally as Wayne, and its members are known as Men of the Manor or
        Manorites. It formed as a non-Greek alternative to fraternity life in
        1981.

        Wayne Manor After BOG's dissolution, its former members established
        Wayne Manor in Wannamaker Dormitory on Duke University's West
        Campus. Its name referenced the home of Bruce Wayne, Batman’s
        alter ego. The organization began as a Commitment House, meaning only
        one-third of its members were selected for membership and the rest
        joined via a lottery. Wayne Manor become a Selective Living Group
        (SLG) in 1992. Wayne Manor emerged as an alternative to
        fraternity life at Duke University, prioritizing both social engagement
        and community service without requiring mandatory pledging. It
        selects members irrespective of race, religion, socioeconomic status, or
        sexual orientation. The organization emphasizes personal growth,
        engagement in community service projects, fostering faculty interaction,
        and organizing social events such as mixers, formal dances, and
        campus-wide parties. Its Malt Liquor Thursdays (M.L.T.) has
        been a campus-wide event since 1994. In the early 2000s, Wayne Manor
        was known for hosting a weekly poker game with a $100 buy-in. In
        2007, some Duke students expressed discontent with the selective-living
        model because it allowed organizations like Wayne Manor to dominate a
        dorm's living spaces. To create a more inclusive experience, Duke
        University banned the recruitment of first-year students by Greek
        fraternities and non-Greek selective living groups, including Wayne
        Manor, in 2021. In response, all fraternities at Duke disaffiliated
        from the Duke Interfraternity Council in favor of the Durham
        Interfraternity Council. Soon after, Duke University announced the
        discontinuation of on-campus housing for SLGs after the 2023–2024
        academic year. While many SLGs transitioned to a Living-Learning
        Community model to retain on-campus housing, Wayne Manor remained an SLG
        and relocated to off-campus accommodations. Despite disaffiliating
        from Duke, Wayne Manor continues to participate in mandatory pre-rush
        training conducted by student-led groups, Duke Sexual Harassment and
        Assault Prevention and Education (SHAPE) and Duke Sexual Assault
        Prevention Team (SAPT).
